=============

This section presents the different publications and scientific works linked to the ThermoCycle library.
This works focus either on the library itself, on the numerical methods, or on the use of the library for particular cases.

Awards
------

The Thermocycle library was awarded with the 2nd price for contributing the free Modelica library by the board of the 10th International Modelica Conference.
