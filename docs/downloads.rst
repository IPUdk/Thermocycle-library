This is the download page for the ThermoCycle library. Note that this might not be the latest version, since it is only released at regular intervals.
The latest version of the libraries can be obtained from the Github ThermoCycle page.

The ThermoCycle Library
-----------------------

Contains the main models of the library, plus several examples of thermodynamic cycles.

Version 1.x is compatible with Dymola2014 backwards and it requires the CoolProp2Modelica library to compute the working fluid properties.

Version 2.x is compatible with Dymola2015 and it requires the ExternalMedia library to compute the working fluid properties.

The ExternalMedia Library
-------------------------

The ExternalMedia Library is the interface between Modelica and external fluid properties libraries, namely CoolProp, an open-source thermodynamic and
transport property software database and FluidProp. It is compatible with the ThermoCycle library version 2.x and Dymola2015.

ThermoCycle Viewer
------------------

Useful tool to display the tabular data (e.g. heat exchanger temperature profiles) and thermodynamic states of the ThermoCycle simulation results.
